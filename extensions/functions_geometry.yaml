    name: "point"
    description: >
      Returns a 2D point with the given `x` and `y` coordinate values.
    impls:
      - args:
          - name: x
            value: fp64
          - name: y
            value: fp64

  -
    name: "makeline"
    description: >
      Returns a linestring connecting the endpoint of geometry `x` to the begin point of
      geometry `y`. Repeated points at the beginning of input geometries are collapsed to a single point.

      A linestring can be closed or simple.  A closed linestring starts and ends on the same
      point. A simple linestring does not cross or touch itself.
    impls:
      - args:
          - name: x
            value: u!geometry
          - name: y
            value: u!geometry
        return: u!geometry
  -
    name: "x_coordinate"
    description: >
      Return the x coordinate of the point.  Return null if not available.
    impls:
      - args:
          - name: point
            value: u!geometry
        return: fp64
  -
    name: "y_coodinate"
    description: >
      Return the y coordinate of the point.  Return null if not available.

      - args:
          - name: point
            value: u!geometry
        return: fp64

    name: "numpoints"
    description: >
      Return the number of points in the geometry.  The geometry should be an linestring
      or circularstring.
    impls:
      - args:
          - name: geom
            value: u!geometry
        return: i64

    name: "isempty"
    description: >
      Return true is the geometry is an empty geometry.
    impls:

            value: u!geometry
        return: boolean

    name: "isclosed"
    description: >
      Return true if the geometry's start and end points are the same.

            value: geometry

    description: >
      Return true if the geometry does not self intersect.

    name: "isring"
    description: >
      Return true if the geometry's start and end points are the same and it does not self
      intersect.

          - name: geom
            value: u!geometry

    name: "geometrytype"
    description: >
      Return the type of geometry as a string.
    impls:

            value: u!geometry
        return: string
  -
    name: "envelope"
    description: >
      Return the minimum bounding box for the input geometry as a geometry.

      The returned geometry is defined by the corner points of the bounding box.  If the
      input geometry is a point or a line, the returned geometry can also be a point or line.
    impls:
      - args:
          - name: geom
            value: u!geometry
        return: u!geometry
  -
    name: "dimension"
    description: >
      Return the dimension of the input geometry.  If the input is a collection of geometries,
      return the largest dimension from the collection. Dimensionality is determined by
      the complexity of the input and not the coordinate system being used.
