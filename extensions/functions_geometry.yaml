    description: >
      Returns a 2D point with the given `x` and `y` coordinate values.
    impls:
      - args:
          - name: x
            value: fp64
          - name: y
            value: fp64
        return: u!geometry

    name: "makeline"
    description: >
      Returns a linestring connecting the endpoint of geometry `x` to the begin point of
      geometry `y`. Repeated points at the beginning of input geometries are collapsed to a single point.

      A linestring can be closed or simple.  A closed linestring starts and ends on the same
      point. A simple linestring does not cross or touch itself.
    impls:
      - args:
          - name: x
            value: u!geometry
          - name: y
            value: u!geometry
        return: u!geometry
