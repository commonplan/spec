              Number of decimal places to be rounded to.

              When `s` is a positive number, the rounding
              is performed to a `s` number of decimal places.

              When `s` is a negative number, the rounding is
              performed to the left side of the decimal point
              as specified by `s`.

              This is an optional argument `function`, a numeric
              value determines whether to perform round or truncate.
              When the `function` value is set to 0, the function
              performs rounding to `s` decimal places, otherwise it
              performs truncate. The default value is 0.
