              When `s` is a positive number, the rounding
              is performed to a `s` number of decimal places.

              When `s` is a negative number, the rounding is
              performed to the left side of the decimal point
              as specified by `s`.
        options:
          rounding:
            values: [ TIE_TO_EVEN, TIE_AWAY_FROM_ZERO, TRUNCATE, CEILING, FLOOR,
              AWAY_FROM_ZERO, TIE_DOWN, TIE_UP, TIE_TOWARDS_ZERO, TIE_TO_ODD ]
