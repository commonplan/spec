# User-Defined Functions

Substrait supports the creation of custom functions using the function signature facilities described in [scalar functions](scalar_functions.md) and the simple extension YAML files described in [extensions](../extensions/index.md). In fact, the functions defined by Substrait use the same mechanism. The extension files for them can be found [here](https://github.com/substrait-io/substrait/tree/main/extensions).
