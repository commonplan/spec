# User-Defined Functions

Substrait supports the creation of custom functions using [simple extensions](../extensions/index.md#simple-extensions), using the facilities described in [scalar functions](scalar_functions.md). The functions defined by Substrait use the same mechanism. The extension files for standard functions can be found [here](https://github.com/substrait-io/substrait/tree/main/extensions).

Here's an example function that doubles its input:

!!! info inline end "Implementation Note"
    This implementation is only defined on 32-bit floats and integers but could be defined on all numbers (and even lists and strings).

``` yaml
%YAML 1.2
---
scalar_functions:
  -
    name: "double"
    description: "Double the value"
    impls:
      - args:
          - name: x
            value: fp32
        options:
          on_domain_error:
            values: [ NAN, ERROR ]
        return: fp32
      - args:
          - name: x
            value: i32
        options:
          on_domain_error:
            values: [ NAN, ERROR ]
        return: i32
```
