# Code samples and examples

It's very useful to have examples of how APIs are used; both to get information on the best practices for using APIs and ideas of how they can be used. 

Each language binding is intended to contain examples that are relevant to that language. New contributions are always welcome.

## Java

- [Substrait-Spark](https://github.com/substrait-io/substrait-java/tree/main/examples/substrait-spark) this demonstrates how Substrait plans can be created and consumed within Apache Spark. The examples run within a simple Spark cluster, composed by a couple of Docker containers.
